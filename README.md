#All Ears
All Ears is a web app for teaching musical ear training and evaluating performance. To many, being able to play what you hear in your head or learn a song without sheet music is the ultimate goal, regardless of genre or instrument. Anyone can improve their ear, and it does not require perfect pitch.

Development tools used: HTML/CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Angular.js, D3.js.

Uses a virtual piano in the browser, adapted from http://jazz-soft.net/doc/JZZ/.
